        While there's no official confirmation of a new Bieber song, the purported track is doing the rounds as Diddy faces sex-abuse allegations.In April 2024, rumors circulated on social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube suggesting that Justin Bieber would release a new song containing the lyric, "Lost myself at a Diddy party," about rapper and producer Sean "Diddy" Combs. The posts included audio that purported to be Bieber singing. The lyrics of the song narrate an experience at a party hosted by Diddy, expressing Bieber's disillusionment with fame and fortune. The opening verse contains the following lyrics:<i>"Lost myself at a Diddy party, didn't know that's how it go, I was in it for a new Ferrari, but it cost me way more than my soul, wasn't worth all the fortune and fame."</i>

    However, there was no concrete evidence to substantiate the existence of this song, including no official confirmation from credible sources or news outlets. Many online commenters called it out as a song generated by artificial intelligence.<br>Snopes reached out to Bieber's management and record labels for comment, but received no immediate reply. We will update this story if they respond.

    Famously discovered at age 13 by talent manager Scooter Braun, Bieber was quickly taken under the wing of R&B singer Usher.<br> Bieber's relationship with Diddy began when the young star was reportedly 15, with Diddy acting as his mentor and the two spending time in the recording studio together. Diddy surprised fans with Bieber's inclusion on his 2023 studio release, "The Love Album: Off the Grid," with Bieber providing guest vocals on the track "Moments."
